# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are fundamental object-oriented design principles that help create maintainable and scalable software.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP) 
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Add new functionality by extending existing code rather than changing it.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Break down large interfaces into smaller ones.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details.

## Benefits of SOLID

- Maintainable code
- Easy to understand and extend
- Reusable components
- Testable code
- Reduced coupling
- Better code organization
